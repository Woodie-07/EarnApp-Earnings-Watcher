# EarnApp Earnings Watcher
A python program to monitor your EarnApp earnings and send the data to a Discord webhook.

## Installation
First, install the required dependencies:
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Next, edit the config.yml file to your liking. The main things you need to do are:
- Set the `webhookURLs` to include your Discord webhook URL(s).
- Set the `tokens` to include your EarnApp `oauth-refresh-token` token(s).

If you would like to read more about the config.yml file, you can view the [configuration section](#configuration).

## Configuration
The configuration file is located at `config.yml`. The file is in YAML format. Each option is documented with the comment next to it. Proper documentation may potentially maybe be coming soon.

## Support
If you have any questions or need help, please contact me on Discord (Woodie#1096) or email me (woodie@woodie.cf). Unfortunately, you won't find me on the EarnApp official discord as I am banned, but you can still send me a friend request and message me that way.
